# Resonate Contacts

As part of my application process, I was assigned the task of creating a "Contacts" application that is engaging and visually appealing for users to browse through their contacts. I used React to develop the Resonate Contacts application. During the development process, I enjoyed experimenting with different layouts, designs, and themes to create the best possible user experience. After careful consideration, I opted for a relatively simple layout, but complemented it with a "Bubblegum" theme that adds energy and liveliness to the application.

## Techonologies Used

- React
- Tailwind.CSS
- Google-Fonts (Agbalumo, Ubuntu)
- Icons From Lucide
